## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a transformative approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing their inherent limitations in factual accuracy and currency. At its core, RAG optimizes LLM outputs by referencing an authoritative knowledge base external to the model's original training data before generating a response. This mechanism significantly enhances both the factual precision and contextual relevance of the LLM's output.

## Project Management
Project management involves the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. It is a discipline focused on planning, executing, and overseeing projects to achieve specific objectives, ensuring completion within budget, on time, and to the required quality.
